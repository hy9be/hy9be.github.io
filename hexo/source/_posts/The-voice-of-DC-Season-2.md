As none of XY, me and YM could lead the arrangement of The Voice of DC Season 2, JB who was in the team for season 1 did take the initiative.

Honestly, I do not think this is a good time to do this event. It takes years for a Chinese community of a metropolitan area (e.g. us at Washington DC) to accumulate a group of qualified singers for a event like this. The Season 1 is in the fall of 2013. Two years, for me, is obviously not long enough to come the "years". But powerful people want this happen, so it happens.

JB is that kind of personal, who will be the last one on your list when you want to find down-to-earth people with good executive force. He is extremely social with very limited sincere interests on the others, thus he owns very broad but low quality network. The task he worked on usually will be behind schedule and carelessly planned (for example today, we find out he never had informed the host about the requirements on microphone and audio system, and, he is 30 mins late for the screening as the main representers of the organizing committee). So, to be simple, I do not want to work with him. But I am still getting involved as a judger for the preliminary screening on singers. This time we have about 80 singers signed up for the event. We need to pick 40 out of them for the second phase, where the coaches will form their team and perform trainings.

This is not an easy job, I have to devote two days (about 16 hours) during this weekend, and present in three different locations, to listen, make judgement, and discuss with the other judgers. Now after Day 1, I already feel exhausted.

During the screening, as expected, I did not see as many good singers as I saw for Season 1. But it was still an interesting experience to listen to the singers and try to figure out their potentials. I used my two pass cards to make a UVa alumni and a rocker directly enters the phase two.

And I get to know another judger, a girl named Angela. She is pretty out-going and easy to work with. That made my day a bit easier.

YM provided rides for us for the whole day. Thanks for that!

Tomorrow is Day 2. I really need to go to bed early tonight.
