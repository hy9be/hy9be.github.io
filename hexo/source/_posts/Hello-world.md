I joined a group on <http://www.coach.me>  named "#500WD" today, and will start to write something periodically (I do not want to set a hard goal of 7 days a week and 500 words each time, but I will try to write as much as possible).

I will write mainly in English. I am very lucky as a foreigner staying at the United States: I have a large group of Chinese friends; my manager and most of my colleagues speaks Chinese; I have easy access to all kinds of Chinese supermarket and restaurants; ... As a result, I do not really feel the lonely of staying abroad alone. But I feel I took too much advantages on these lucky things and is implicitly taking very high risk of losing them. I must be prepared in case these are all taken away from me some day. To write a blog in English is a start point.

The content will be various. I am a geek, a top Chinese singer, a readingholic, a 15 year fan of basketball, and many more...I will write anything I like, hate or feel indifferent.

I do not plan to buy a domain name for this blog, though blogs on *.github.io domain names usually are focusing on programming.

Okay, I guess this is already pretty long for a post named "Hello word".
